# ActivityTracker
This repos is a forked of the original application created by CWayne18. 

The application has been upgraded to work only on 16.04 ubuntu touch. 

## Majors changes :
- Update of the QML code,
- Change the tile service to QML/OSM. 
- Implement a routing to parse locally the gps track
- Allow to set the frequency of position recording. (it's advice to have a frequency not below 10 or 5 seconds in or to not saturate the gpx file. More data point the gpx has, longer it will take to display it.)

## General information
 - Due to OS limitation the recording must happen screen on
 - The gpx files are located in .local/share/activitytracker.actidev/
 
 ## Thanks 
  - Michele for the logo
  - Joan CiberSheep for the icons.
