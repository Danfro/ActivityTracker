# ActivityTracker
This repository is a fork of the [Xenial app version](https://github.com/ernesst/ActivityTracker) by @ernesst and @mymike00, which itself is a fork of the original app created by [@cwayne18](https://github.com/cwayne18/ActivityTracker).


Due to older QML lib on the original 15.04 version, the changes cannot be retrofitted.
The app has been upgraded by Michele and Ernes_t to work on 16.04 Ubuntu Touch. They did develop it until v0.15
@Danfro (myself) did now update the app to work on focal.

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/Danfro/ActivityTracker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of changes.

## General information
 - due to a OS limitation the recording must occur with the screen on, otherwise the app is send to background and can not receive position information anymore
 - the GPX files are located in .local/share/activitytracker.cwayne18/
 - currently the map shows "api key required", this is know and hopefully can be fixed soon
